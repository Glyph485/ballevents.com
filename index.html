				<p>My name is Lindsey Ball and I’m the insanely happy bride on your left.</p>
				<p>For the lifetime that preceded this moment, I was obsessed with planning the perfect events. 
				I planned fundraisers in my neighborhood, block parties for the 4th of July, and put on many 
				(not at all embarrassing) plays and dance recitals organized by, and starring, me. In my adult 
				life I’ve continued the tradition by planning fundraising events, training events, friends’ weddings, 
				and my own wedding.</p>
				<p>I spent a great deal of time pouring my heart into my wedding, planning every detail in a million 
				spreadsheets. Then I decided I wanted someone to help and manage the details during the wedding day so that I could 
				enjoy being present with my new husband. Sadly, that was not entirely the outcome. But it was the impetus I needed to follow my passion.</p>
				<p>Have a Ball Events promises that every couple, company, family and friend will feel nothing but joy about an event 
				in which I’m involved. My mission is to make each event vision come to life, and ensure we have a ball in the process!</p>
				<p>All the best!</p>
				<p>Lindsey</p>
